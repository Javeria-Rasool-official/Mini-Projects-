# Mini-Projects

<p>I'm thrilled to share a series of mini projects I've been working on, all crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects have been a fantastic learning journey, helping me to hone my web development skills and explore various functionalities.</p>

<h4>Here they are:<h4>

<h2>Apple-Inspired Calculator:</h2><p> A sleek and stylish calculator that mirrors the design of Apple devices. This project taught me a lot about creating visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces.<p>

<h2>Multiplication App:</h2> This app not only multiplies two numbers but also updates the score if the user inputs the correct answer. It was a great way to delve into interactive and dynamic web elements.

<h2>Tic Tac Toe Game:</h2> A fully functional Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against another player. Building this game helped me understand game logic and user interaction on a deeper level.

<h2>Weather App:</h2> Using a JavaScript API, this app provides real-time weather updates based on the city you search for. Integrating an API was a challenging yet rewarding experience, enhancing my JavaScript skills significantly.

<h2>Palindrome Checker:</h2> A tool that checks if a word or sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward, such as "madam" or "racecar". This project was a fun way to practice string manipulation and logic in JavaScript.

<h2>Roman Numeral Converter:</h2> A tool that converts modern numbers into their Roman numeral equivalents, such as converting 1987 to "MCMLXXXVII". This project allowed me to practice conditional logic and loops in JavaScript, as well as understand the structure of the Roman numeral system. It also involved input validation and creating a user-friendly interface.

Each of these projects has been a stepping stone in my coding journey, providing valuable insights and practical experience. I'm excited to continue learning and creating!
