# Mini-Projects

<p>I'm thrilled to share a series of mini projects I've been working on, all crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects have been a fantastic learning journey, helping me to hone my web development skills and explore various functionalities.</p>

<h1>Here they are:</h1>

<h2>Apple-Inspired Calculator:</h2><p> A sleek and stylish calculator that mirrors the design of Apple devices. This project taught me a lot about creating visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces.<p>

Multiplication App: This app not only multiplies two numbers but also updates the score if the user inputs the correct answer. It was a great way to delve into interactive and dynamic web elements.

Tic Tac Toe Game: A fully functional Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against another player. Building this game helped me understand game logic and user interaction on a deeper level.

Weather App: Using a JavaScript API, this app provides real-time weather updates based on the city you search for. Integrating an API was a challenging yet rewarding experience, enhancing my JavaScript skills significantly.

Restaurant Website: A complete website designed for a restaurant, focusing on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This project allowed me to explore responsive design and effective layout techniques.

Palindrome Checker: A tool that checks if a word or sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward, such as "madam" or "racecar". This project was a fun way to practice string manipulation and logic in JavaScript.

Each of these projects has been a stepping stone in my coding journey, providing valuable insights and practical experience. I'm excited to continue learning and creating!
